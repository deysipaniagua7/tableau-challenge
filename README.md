# **Tableau Challenge**

This is the repository that holds my Module 18 tableau-challenge.

## **Module Overview**
Citi Bike is the largest bike-sharing program in the United States. While monthly data is collected, organized, and made publicly available on the programâ€™s webpage, no dashboard or advanced reporting system exists.  

Our objective was to develop a Tableau report that provides key program insights for city officials.

## **Data Retrieval and Cleaning**
The data for this report was obtained from the Citi Bikeâ€™s Data webpage.  
Four datasets were downloaded, cleaned, and merged using Python:  
- July 2023
- December 2023
- July 2024
- December 2024

The final merged dataset was then used to generate visualizations in Tableau.

## **Tableau Visualizations**
- **Note:** Ride IDs corresponding to June and November data were excluded from the analysis to ensure a consistent comparison between summer (July) and winter (December). The final report is based on 331,276 Ride IDs. Dashboards contain a Year filter, allowing for customizable visualizations.
